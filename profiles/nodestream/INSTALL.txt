REQUIREMENTS
------------

NodeStream is distributed with one .make file and one .profile file. The
.make file defines what packages that must be downloaded and the .profile file
is responsible for configuring all those modules.

To run this .make file you need two things:

 * Drush (http://drupal.org/project/drush)
 * Drush Make (http://drupal.org/project/drush_make)
 * Git

For instructions on how to install those packages, please consult their
respective documentation.

INSTALLATION
------------

1. DOWNLOAD DRUPAL CORE

   Fetch Drupal core and extract it in the web root of your server. NodeStream
   is compatible with Drupal Core 7.x.

   * The recommended way of fetching core is through drush.
     run this command:
       drush dl drupal-7
   * You can also download drupal core from http://drupal.org/project/drupal.
     Always take the latest version of core.

1. DOWNLOAD NODESTREAM

   Currently NodeStream can only be fetched directly from the GIT repository.
   This is because of incompatibility with the packaging system on drupal.org.

   * Go to the profiles directory in your drupal core installation:
       cd profiles/
   * run the following command:
       git clone --branch 7.x-2.x http://git.drupal.org/project/nodestream.git
   * change to the new directory:
       cd nodestream
   * You now have the 7.x branch of NodeStream. If you want you can check out a specific version check out that version tag, for example:
       git checkout 7.x-2.x-alpha1

   Fetching NodeStream from GIT will create a directory containing only the
   .make file, the .profile file and some include files. In the following
   examples we assume this drectory is called nodestream/.

2. RUN THE MAKE FILE TO DOWNLOAD ALL REQUIRED PACKAGES

   In order to get all the required packages for NodeStream you need to
   run the make file.

   * Go into the nodestream folder if you are not already there and run the following:
     drush make --no-core --contrib-destination=. nodestream.make
   * That's it, you now have a working copy of NodeStream!

4. INSTALL NODESTREAM

   From now on, the steps to get your site up and running is the same as with a
   regular Drupal site. Set up your settings file and database as usual and go to
   http://yourdomain.com/install.php. Select NodeStream as your profile when you install!
   For more detailed instructions, please consult the Drupal installation instructions from
   step 2 in /your-web-root/INSTALL.txt
